A collection of various different games that can be ran on my person game engine, including:
1) A fluid simualtion wrapped into a single planet using spherical geometry
2) A tycoon where players shrink down to build 3D models using cubes that are evaulated using my own formula of "good looks"
3) A showcase game where the player can walk around a scene with various models with different materials. The models bob up and down and the player can interact with the models to make them spin.
4) An infinite cube slider game where the player attempts to dodge "enemy" cubes as long as possible
5) An offline rendering mode, which allows a user to render a single high quality frame of a given model using the engine. 


NOTE: The games frequently mention models that do not exist within any of my repositories. I have purposefully omitted them due to copyright concerns. Please find different models to take their places.
